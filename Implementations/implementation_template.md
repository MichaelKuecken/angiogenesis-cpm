**Use of the CC3D implementation.**

1) Install CC3D
2) Copy the whole compucell3d folder locally (can rename the folder once copied)
3) Run compucell3d (either tweedit or player)
4) Open CC3D project -> angio.cc3d
5) Press play

The core of the simulation (constraints, adhesion, secretion/diffusion, 
chemotaxis, and associated parameters) are all located in the Simulation folder
in the angio.xml file.
