This repository contains high-level description and schemas to create CPM simulations of Angiogenesis based on previous work published in:

    R Merks et al, PLOS Comp. Biol, 2008. "Contact-Inhibited Chemotaxis in De Novo and Sprouting Blood-Vessel Growth"

## Background
Angiogenesis is a fundamental patterning process in developmental biology. It shows a great deal of adaptability depending on initial and boundary conditions. This is fundamentally a model of in vitro angiogenesis in which we put endothelial cells into a cell culture context (either 2D as in most angio experiments or 3D). The analogy would be closest to the formation of peripheral capillaries during primary vasculogenesis. The model can also illustrate an abstraction of branching angiogenesis.

The model involves only one cell type and one chemical field. It illustrates complex patterning through autocrine chemotaxis, contact inhibition and volume exclusion. Can include elongated cell shapes. 

Tests: diffusion rate, chemotaxis, cell movement, cell-cell contact energies.
